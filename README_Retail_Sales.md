##  Key Analysis & Insights

### PostgreSQL (SQL Queries)
- Created and managed a **Retail Sales database**  
- Data Cleaning: Removed null/missing values  
- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with queries  
- Derived business insights such as:  
  - Top categories and customer demographics  
  - Peak sales months  
  - High-value transactions  
  - Gender and shift-wise analysis  

### Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Loaded sales dataset into Pandas Data Frame  
- Applied NumPy & Pandas for aggregations and transformations  
- Built visualizations for better understanding of trends:  
  - Monthly sales trends  
  - Category-wise sales performance  
  - Customer demographics (age, gender)  
  - Top 5 customers by revenue
